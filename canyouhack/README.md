### Solve the Challenges

This website contains a series of security challenges. We do not expect people to finish all of them (although it's great if you do!), they are to gauge strengths/weaknesses as well as interest in security. The challenges are limited to the canyouhack.us domain and server. You can get started by carefully examining the website.

### No Spoilers Please

Please do not post public write-ups, we use this site as a way to vet potential new hires and provide exercises for those who want to learn more about security. Creating and hosting challenges takes a fair bit of work and we don't want it to go to waste. If you do feel compelled to do a writeup feel free to send it our way and maybe score an interview.

If you are working on these challenges and are interested in applying for a position at Security Innovation (full time or intern) we would suggest staying away from write-ups. You will miss out on the learning that comes from trial and error and will have a more difficult time in the interview process. Take your time, enjoy the challenges, and best of luck!

Looking at the page source you see a hidden href do a debug page

```html
<!-- IMPORTANT! DONT! FORGET -->
<!-- TODO: remove this link before deploying to production  -->
<a hidden href="/debug"> debug </a>
<!-- IMPORTANT! DONT! FORGET -->

```

Going to `https://canyouhack.us/debug` redirects you to the scoreboard with the first two challenges.
