### Solve the Challenges

This website contains a series of security challenges. We do not expect people to finish all of them (although it's great if you do!), they are to gauge strengths/weaknesses as well as interest in security. The challenges are limited to the canyouhack.us domain and server. You can get started by carefully examining the website.

### No Spoilers Please

Please do not post public write-ups, we use this site as a way to vet potential new hires and provide exercises for those who want to learn more about security. Creating and hosting challenges takes a fair bit of work and we don't want it to go to waste. If you do feel compelled to do a writeup feel free to send it our way and maybe score an interview.

If you are working on these challenges and are interested in applying for a position at Security Innovation (full time or intern) we would suggest staying away from write-ups. You will miss out on the learning that comes from trial and error and will have a more difficult time in the interview process. Take your time, enjoy the challenges, and best of luck!
