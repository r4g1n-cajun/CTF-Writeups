### Exploitation Challenge

There was only one challenge in this category, and it wasn't even exploitation it was cracking a password hash which would be needed in other challenges.

### Steps Taken:

***Identify the Hash***

```

***Crack the Hash***

Normally I would use Hashcat with masks and rules but.... I'm lazy and don't have time for that since the CTF has a timeline.

So I used https://hashkiller.co.uk/sha1-decrypter.aspx BOOM.... got it. I should have figured it was an easy password but based on some of these other challenges... there was no telling.
