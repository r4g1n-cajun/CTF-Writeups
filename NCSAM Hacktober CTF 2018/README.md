## Writeups for the challenges that I was able to complete in the NCSAM Hacktober CTF hosted by the Midwest Cyber Center

This was an awesome CTF and I had a lot of fun doing it. It lasted one week and I worked on it as I had time periodically through out the day and later at night.

Some of the challenge catagories I have had no experience in so it was a first for me and I had to learn as I went along.

# Overall
- Came in 17th out of 140 teams.
- This was my first 'real' CTF that wasn't just basic pentesting against some VMs.
- Some of the flags I was able to find without completely reversing/decompiling binaries so those won't be very detailed.
