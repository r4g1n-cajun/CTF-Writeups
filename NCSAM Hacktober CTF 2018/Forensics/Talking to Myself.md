### Description:

The police have tracked one of the Ghostf4c3 membersâ€™ locations. They have captured some traffic, but are unsure of what to do with it next. Help stop the Ghostf4c3 crew by assisting the police however they ask.

S13ndermann was having a conversation with someone and the police believe that he mentioned a secret word (flag) in that conversation. Find the flag.

### File:

[pcap](https://github.com/r4g1n-cajun/CTF-Writeups/raw/master/NCSAM%20Hacktober%20CTF%202018/Forensics/Files/3N3pnespviuVCNqXWiLAY44Ct2Ph1xNd.zip)


### Steps Taken

This challenge uses the same PCAP file as ***S13ndermann needs help*** where the IP was the flag.

The 'challenge' is to find a secret word used in a conversation with someone within the PCAP. Well, if you remember we already found that in the TCP Stream of the freenode IRC connection from ***S13ndermann needs help***.
