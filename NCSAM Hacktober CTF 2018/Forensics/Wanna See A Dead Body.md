### Points: 500
  - I didn't complete this challenge during the CTF. 

### Description:

ShowMeCorp recently found one of it’s employees, Philipe, had been kidnapped and sold on the dark web. There are not many clues, but we have a strong reason to believe that the man who sat next to him might have had his computer hacked into. We believe that this hacking organization may have used this initial access to find personal information on Philipe that would have led to his kidnapping

After initial access onto Ted’s PC, the attacker migrated into a process. At what time was this newly injected process launched?

Flag will be in the format HH:MM:SS
