## Adventure Challenges

The entire Adventure category was an MMO (Mass Multiplayer Online) game, with four challenges that involved walking around the map and completing tasks in the game to obtain the required flags.

These challenges were easy to complete and was a nice little break from the actual challenges.

Opening developer tools when launching the game you see a GET request for the `db.json` file with a `304` response... so taking a look you can see the categorized breakdown of the game. Since each challenge is finding a specific 'item' then everything needed to complete them all should be right here, which they are (including the flags). Looking at the NPC (Non Playable Character) section we see 'rick' which is the first challenge and have the flag.

But that wouldn't be very fun and a break from beating my brain was nice so I played through.

It took a while to figure out where everything was without using the `db.json` info.
