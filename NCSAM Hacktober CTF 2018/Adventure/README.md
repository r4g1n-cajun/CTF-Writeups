## Adventure Challenges

The entire Adventure category was an MMO (Mass Multiplayer Online) game, with four challenges that involved walking around the map and completing tasks in the game to obtain the required flags.

These challenges were easy to complete and was a nice little break from the actual challenges.

Opening developer tools when launching the game you see a GET request for the `db.json` file with a `304` response... so taking a look you can see the categorized breakdown of the game. Since each challenge is finding a specific 'item' then everything needed to complete them all should be right here, which they are (including the flags). Looking at the NPC (Non Playable Character) section we see 'rick' which is the first challenge and have the flag.

But that wouldn't be very fun and a break from beating my brain was nice so I played through. But that wouldn't be very fun and a break from beating my brain was nice so I played through.

### Wubba Lubba

***Points: 100***

***Description:***
  - Find Rick!

***Flag***
  - ```flag-NoPicklesHere```
  - Gotta love the Pickle Rick Reference! This one was a pain in the ass, he was in a cave that had multiple paths once inside and they would spit you back to the entrance.

### Adventure Kitty

***Points: 100***

  - There's a kitty with a message for you!

### Find Frodo's Sword

***Points: 200***

***Description***
  - Find The Sword Frodo would have used.
  - Pay close attention when you pick it up.


***Flag***
  - ```flag-GollumWasTheHero```
  - This one actually took a couple times since I was expecting some crazy action to obtain the sword but that wasn't the case. I got it a few times but didn't pay close attention when I picket it up....

### Slay the Evil

***Points: 300***

***Description***

  - Slay the greatest Evil in the land.
  - Your reward will be protection and a flag!

***Flag***
  - ```flag-BlingBlingBaby```
  - For this one all you had to do was follow the 'path' to the top of the map and you arrive at a lava surrounded temple. Once inside you had to battle and kill the 'Evil Boss' character and a chest appeared with Golden Armor in it. Once you obtain the armor you receive the last flag.
